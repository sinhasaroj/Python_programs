Multitasking -- In computing, multitasking is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks 
(also known as processes) over a certain period of time.

Two types of multitasking:--> 1. Process based multitasking a
                              2. Thread based multitasking

1 . Process based multitasking --> Executing several tasks independently where each task is a seperate process
for eg. our computer system. os level

2. Thread based multitasking --> Executing several tasks simultaneously, 
where each task is a seperate independent part of the same program, and each independently part is know as thread.

Note: Whether it is process based or thread based, the main advantage of multi tasking is
to improve performance of the system by reducing response time.

The main important application areas of multi threading are:
1) To implement Multimedia graphics
2) To develop animations
3) To develop video games
4) To develop web and application servers
etc...

Note: Where ever a group of independent jobs are available, then it is highly
recommended to execute simultaneously instead of executing one by one.For such type of
cases we should go for Multi Threading.

Python provides one inbuilt module "threading" to provide support for developing
threads. Hence developing multi threaded Programs is very easy in python.

Every Python Program by default contains one thread which is nothing but MainThread.
