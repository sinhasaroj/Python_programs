"""
Implementation using collections.deque:
Python stack can be implemented using deque class from collections module. 
Deque is preferred over list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations 
from both the ends of the container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and 
pop operations as compared to list which provides O(n) time complexity. 

The same methods on deque as seen in list are used, append() and pop().

print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
 
print('\nStack after elements are poped:')

# uncommenting print(stack.pop())  
# will cause an IndexError
